	<!-- EDIT THE DESCRIPTION HERE -->
	Tuatapere is a beautiful small town in Western Southland where I was lucky to be born. It boasts the tile of NZ capital of sausages and is built off the blood sweat and tears of native bush logging industry from over 150 years till present. Tuatapere has a population of approx 500 people. Despite this, the town still has three local pubs too choose from. Although these are not on the map, this beautiful web map shows some fun activities to explore. Ask for a tour at the local timber mill, go for a swim at the boat ramp (WARNING toxic algae), check out one of the beautiful ancient totara trees, or gaze on the beauty of the mighty Waiau River (unfortunately severly poluted from dairy run off and low controlled water flow, thanks Meridian!).
